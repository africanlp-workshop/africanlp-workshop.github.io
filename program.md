## Program

The workshop format has been updated to try be as inclusive of as many timezones as possible. The workshop will be split into a UCT Morning session which is Europe, Africa and Asia friendly, and an evening session which is more America friendly. 

The invited and contributed talks are pre-recorded with Q&A Sessions. The poster sessions also consist of quick talks.
